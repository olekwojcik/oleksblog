Setting aside the strangely rosy opinion many Americans I encounter in my day-to-day life have of appeasement to fascists, one thing jumps out at me in all of this. Why is it that most discussions I witness these days concerns what </span><span class="c1">Ukraine</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;should do and not what </span><span class="c1">Russia</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;should do? An invasion is the most textbook example of a </span><span class="c1">violation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of sovereignty. During a Russian invasion of Ukraine, how is Russia not the agentive party? </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain &ldquo;realist&rdquo; theorists such as </span><span class="c7 c2"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-john-mearsheimer-blames-the-us-for-the-crisis-in-ukraine&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1735155336553769&amp;usg=AOvVaw11OqA5joz_TD6i-rJDf2R8">John Measheimer</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;push a bizarre narrative that Russia had no choice but to invade Ukraine in order to stop NATO &ldquo;expansion&rdquo;. Why is it that within this frame of thinking, the Russians are forced into invading Ukraine, but NATO and the West </span><span class="c1">do</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have the choice of whether or not to expand? We are always discussing what it is the West and Ukraine should do, while pretending that Russian invasion and genocide is as unstoppable as a natural disaster. All we can do is discuss how to best weather the storm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the best argument for this framing is the idea that since we </span><span class="c1">are</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;within the West, we are the people who are making the decisions. To a lesser extent, since Ukraine is an ally of ours, we have a larger say in what they should do, if not because we have influence with them, then because they share our values and can be reasoned with. For years, the liberal media apparatus in the United States has held democratic candidates to much higher standards than the party of Donald Trump. This has countless examples, most infamously with the Hillary Clinton email scandal. The most recent one is that Donald Trump has been casually threatening to annex Panama, Greenland, and Canada. Instead of acknowledging how insane this is, </span><span class="c2 c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/23/politics/trump-us-expansion-panama-canada-greenland/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1735155336554321&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bGY-bDBNRBxh1O36PjYsN">CNN reports it as this</a></span><span class="c0">: </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President-elect Donald Trump appears to be entertaining an American territorial expansion that, if he&rsquo;s serious, would rival the Louisiana Purchase or the deal that netted Alaska from Russia.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My belief is that a large reason(among other less flattering ones) why liberal media treats Trump so delicately when any other world leader or Democratic president would be instantly condemned is that many within liberal media do not identify with Donald Trump and therefore do not assign him any agency. He is also a force of nature that ought to be reported on like a hurricane rather than a person. We cannot hold him responsible for the deranged things he says because he simply has no choice but to be the way he is. This framing has consequences, however. Portraying Trump as lacking agency and making excuses for his behavior is indistinguishable in practice. But, we can establish as a principle that we tend to assign agency to those that we can </span><span class="c1">identify</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with, which I think makes sense.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c0">But framing certain actors as having agency and others as not is not just a matter of identity. When I was growing up, I remember a lesson in middle school we had about the Israel/Palestine conflict. As an activity, our teacher set up a roleplaying scenario where some of us would be Israeli and some of us would be Palestinian, and we would attempt to find a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; in order to solve the conflict once and for all. I remember our teacher sitting in as a Palestinian, and suggesting to her fellow &ldquo;Palestinians&rdquo; that they ought to become suicide bombers in order to &ldquo;get some virgins in heaven&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days, there is a Palestinian x state solution industrial complex, with many learned scholars showing off their meticulously thought out compromise between Israel and Palestine. But why is it always framed as a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo;? The implication of roundtable simulations and compromise solutions is that both parties share agency in this conflict. But according to our previously established principle, we should be assigning agency to the party we identify closer with. Israel, as a beacon of liberal democracy in the Middle East and an American ally, should be easier to identity with than the Palestinians, and therefore the Israelis should be treated as the agentive party. Despite that, from my middle school class and the solution industrial complex seem to assign an inordinate amount of agency to the Palestinians. Clearly, more is at play here. What is the effect this could have on the perception of the conflict?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is and is not assigned agency, especially on a superficial level, is a very consequential decision that can carry specific intent. By portraying certain people, institutions, or countries as lacking agency we remove moral responsibility from them. Conversely, by assigning agency to parties we can assign responsibility to them even if they are victims. This is the danger, intentional or otherwise, of portraying Ukraine as having the &ldquo;choice&rdquo; of whether or not to compromise with Russia or keep fighting. The way for the war to truly end is for Russia to stop invading&mdash;or for Ukraine to join NATO. I would ask anyone who writes or reads media stories to always keep in mind who is being shown as having agency and who is not, and what effect it has on the framing of the conflict.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
