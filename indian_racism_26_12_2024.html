Vance doesn&rsquo;t hide his disdain for aspects of his hillbilly culture, not shying away from calling some of his people &ldquo;welfare queens&rdquo;. The question that is constantly raised by the book is how much of our lives is determined by ourselves and by our fate. I don&rsquo;t think this question gets fully resolved in the book. On the one hand, JD Vance believes his mother is at least partially responsible for her own addiction&mdash;a position that is easy to understand given JD Vance&rsquo;s unfortunate childhood was her shirked responsibility manifest. On the other, JD Vance attributes his own success to his family and others who helped him along his way into the &ldquo;elites&rdquo;. His grandparents raised him and taught him the value of education while others disparaged &ldquo;nerds&rdquo;, and his friends and mentors at Yale taught him the unspoken rules of elite social gatherings. He acknowledges that without that help, he would never be where is today. I viewed this as a contradiction&mdash;are people responsible for their own fate, or are they just the products of the people who surround them? I think in the conservative mind, this isn&rsquo;t a contradiction. JD Vance, rather than promoting any social or welfare program, ends his book with a call for hillbillies to take responsibility for their own community values and culture, which is a call for the traditional conservative &ldquo;family values&rdquo;. I was unused to this being anything other than a dogwhistle, but I think JD Vance actually meant it. It wasn&rsquo;t a call to individual responsibility, but rather a call to collective responsibility. JD Vance was blaming hillbilly culture, and hillbillies as a group, for their own poverty. And he saw their turn from the Democrats be born of resentment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">President Obama came on the scene right as so many people in my community began to believe that the modern American meritocracy was not built for them. We know were not doing well. We see it every day: in the obituaries for teenage kids that conspicuously omit the cause of death (reading between the lines: overdose), in the deadbeats we watch our daughters waste their time with. Barack Obama strikes at the heart of our deepest insecurities. He is a good father while many of us aren&#39;t. He wears suits to his job while we wear overalls, if we&#39;re lucky enough to have a job at all. His wife tells us that we shouldn&#39;t be feeding our children certain foods, and we hate her for it&mdash;not because we think she&#39;s wrong but because we know she&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-JD Vance, Hillbilly Elegy</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">This Christmas there is a new resentment that is tearing apart the new right-wing coalition, this time targeting Indian-Americans. Indian-Americans are now represented within the MAGA inner circles, from DOGE to Trump&rsquo;s picks for the directors of the FBI and the NIH, among others. But after the appointment of Sriram Krishnan as an AI advisor, Republicans on Twitter began a racist massive anti-Indian and anti-meritocracy campaign online.

Vance notes that the values he was raised with, specifically ones of defensive masculinity&mdash;values that meant that he has to physically attack anyone who insulted his mother&rsquo;s honor, for instance&mdash;are not useful in the modern world. The anger and posturing he inherited from his parent&rsquo;s culture no longer serves any purpose, because the nerds and achievers are the ones who get ahead in the United States today. But JD Vance correctly noticed that telling people that their misfortune is due to their own culture stokes fiery resentment. Successful, smart Indian immigrants, similarly to Obama, represent the kind of success that many in the United States failed to achieve. This is the source of the schism: the idea a people are responsible for their own fate, despite being liberally deployed against black people by conservatives for decades, is too painful when turned at conservatives themselves. Instead, for part of republicans, the narrative becomes that Indians &ldquo;steal&rdquo; jobs from deserving Americans, and then end up hiring more Indians in some large scheme to leech off of the productivity of presumably white America. Any reasonable person can see this is simply untrue, and can point to the wild qualifications of many Indian American immigrants, but any effort of the sort is in vain, because this situation boils down to resentment and envy. It cannot be out-debated with facts and logic, or by pointing out its hypocrisy, no matter how hard the tech right tries. I suspect we are far from the worst of this conflict, and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse over the next four years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I am very interested to see how JD Vance may respond to this schism. I think he understands perfectly what is really going on. He is such an interesting character to me because he has now taken the cynical side of his own insight, exploiting that same resentment he once condemned in order to secure his own power. I suspect he will continue to do so and commit to reducing the number H-1B Visas or something. As someone who was once on an H-4 Visa through of my father&rsquo;s H-1B Visa, I&rsquo;m pretty upset about that. Immigrants are the United States&rsquo; key to success, and if this racist movement succeeds, it won&rsquo;t just be bad for us immigrants, it&rsquo;ll mean the end of America&rsquo;s long-term economic dominance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
