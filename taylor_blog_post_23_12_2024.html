    <h1>The Second Screen & Why People Don't "Get" Taylor Swift</h1>
    <p>Given that I’m a 26-year-old man, it’s a fun novelty these days for me to be a Swiftie. Fellow fans will doubt me, but I was here first, dammit! I’ve been a “Swiftie” since I was eight years old in 2006. I can claim, pretty truthfully, that I did like Taylor Swift before she was “cool”. What used to be my odd fixation with a pretty blonde country singer has turned into a global cult, and I have found it fascinating—if a bit annoying.</p>

    <p>Something that often comes up with conversations relating to Taylor Swift and her recent rocket to super-stardom is people who don’t “get it”. “I listened to her music and I just don’t get it.” It’s already irritating and overdone to point out how irritating and contrarian this is, so instead I would like to put forward my own rationale for why I think the non-Swiftie civilians don’t “get it” while the cult yet grows.</p>

    <p>Anthony Fantano—a popular music reviewer—in his YouTube music album review of Taylor Swift’s <em>The Tortured Poet’s Department</em>, made a comment on the song <em>So Long, London</em> that really stuck out to me. After complaints on the vapidity and unsubtleties of the album, he describes his confusion about this song’s “constant tension and escalation without any release.” I find this comment fascinating because it perfectly captures what most Swifties, including myself, noticed about this song, but seemingly lacks the second-order thought necessary to realize this is an intentional choice by its writer. The constant tension and escalation with no release within the song is meant to mirror the constant tension and escalation with no release within the relationship the song is about. This does not ever occur to Fantano, who says the song left him “scratching [his] head” and asking “what is this?” despite unintentionally perfectly describing the feeling Taylor was evoking.</p>

    <blockquote>
        You swore that you loved me but where were the clues?<br>
        I died on the altar waiting for the proof
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>- So Long, London</em></p>

    <p>A similar—though less subtle—example is the song <em>closure</em> from the album <em>evermore</em>. The song employs an unconventional time measure (5/4) along with a pots-and-pans style percussion in the background, intentionally eliciting an uncomfortable, discordant feeling. One could complain about the measure or the grating audio, since it superficially makes for a worse pop song, but that would be missing the point. The song is about being content without having closure after a relationship, with Taylor being “fine with my spite”. In his review of <em>evermore</em>, Fantano correctly picks up on this theme, though it’d be hard not to. He praises the song, and says: “On this track Taylor doesn’t care about closure—she doesn’t want to be smoothed—she doesn’t want to be soothed. She wants to be jagged—and noisy—and bitter!”</p>

    <blockquote>
        I know I’m just a wrinkle in your new life<br>
        Staying friends would iron it out so nice<br>
        Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea<br>
        That you put between you and me<br>
        But it’s fake, and it’s oh so unnecessary
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>- closure</em></p>

    <p>One could argue that Fantano understood the intent of <em>So Long, London</em> perfectly and either cut his comments on it for time or was intentionally misunderstanding and misrepresenting songs hoping to attract angry Swifties and go viral...</p>
