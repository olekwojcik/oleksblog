Fellow fans will doubt me, but I was here first, dammit! I&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;Swiftie&rdquo; since I was eight years old in 2006. I can claim, pretty truthfully, that I did like Taylor Swift before she was &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. What used to be my odd fixation with a pretty blonde country singer has turned into a global cult, and I have found it fascinating&mdash;if a bit annoying.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Something that often comes up with conversations relating to Taylor Swift and her recent rocket to super-stardom is people who don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get it&rdquo;. &ldquo;I listened to her music and I just don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s already irritating and overdone to point out how irritating and contrarian this is, so instead I would like to put forward my own rationale for why I think the non-swiftie civilians don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get it&rdquo; while the cult yet grows.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Anthony Fantano&mdash;a popular music reviewer&mdash;in his YouTube music album review of Taylor Swift&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">The Tortured Poet&rsquo;s Department</span><span>, made a comment on the song </span><span class="c0">So Long, London</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that really stuck out to me. After complaints on the vapidity and unsubtleties of the album, he describes his confusion about this song&rsquo;s &ldquo;constant tension and escalation without any release.&rdquo; I find this comment fascinating because it perfectly captures what most Swifties, including myself, noticed about this song, but seemingly lacks the second-order thought necessary to realize this is an intentional choice by its writer. The constant tension and escalation with no release within the song is meant to mirror the constant tension and escalation with no release within the relationship the song is about. This does not ever occur to Fantano, who says the song left him &ldquo;scratching [his] head&rdquo; and asking &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo; despite unintentionally perfectly describing the feeling Taylor was evoking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">You swore that you loved me but where were the clues?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c6">I died on the altar waiting for the proof</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c6 c0">-So Long, London</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>A similar&mdash;though less subtle&mdash;example is the song </span><span class="c0">closure</span><span>&nbsp;from the album </span><span class="c0">evermore</span><span>.. The song employs an unconventional time measure (5/4) along with a pots-and-pans style percussion in the background, intentionally eliciting an uncomfortable, discordant feeling. One could complain about the measure or the grating audio, since it superficially makes for a worse pop song, but that would be missing the point. The song is about being content without having closure after a relationship, with Taylor being &ldquo;fine with my spite&rdquo;. In his review of </span><span class="c0">evermore</span><span class="c3">, Fantano correctly picks up on this theme, though it&rsquo;d be hard not to. He praises the song, and says: &ldquo;On this track Taylor doesn&rsquo;t care about closure&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t want to smoothed&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t want to be soothed. She wants to be jagged&mdash;and noisy&mdash;and bitter!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">I know I&rsquo;m just a wrinkle in your new life</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Staying friends would iron it out so nice</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">That you put between you and me</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">But it&rsquo;s fake, and it&rsquo;s oh so unnecessary</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-closure</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that Fantano understood the intent of </span><span class="c0">So Long, London</span><span>&nbsp;perfectly and either cut his comments on it for time or was intentionally misunderstanding and misrepresenting songs hoping to attract angry Swifties and go antiviral. In her article </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-23/taylor-swift-s-tortured-poet-s-department-has-too-many-hasty-reviews&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1735072285619372&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sTD7-xU4a0j3Me5GRC0OL">Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken</a></span><span>, Jessica Karl notes that within 24 hours of </span><span class="c0">The Tortured Poet&rsquo;s Department: The Anthology (TTPD)</span><span>&nbsp;album release, there were plenty of official reviews, including for the </span><span class="c0">New York Times</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">The Atlantic</span><span>, which is simply not enough time to listen to and reflect on an album with 31 songs. It&rsquo;s possible that Fantano, who released his edited video three days after the album, was pushing to get any hot take out at all without much time for actual reflection or analysis.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Whatever the reality, I believe that this is a good example of why someone may not &ldquo;get&rdquo; Taylor Swift. In order to appreciate </span><span class="c0">So Long, London</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;you have to emotionally engage with it. You have to sit with it. You have to give Taylor Swift the benefit of the doubt that she is an artist who makes choices deliberately. If you do not, you too will be left scratching your head in confusion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>One of my favorite shows ever is </span><span class="c0">Succession</span><span>, but I had an issue with actually watching it. In order to catch up with my friends before the final season, I tried to watch it on a second monitor while I worked on another(I have a remote job, sorry). This didn&rsquo;t last long, because the show couldn&rsquo;t be only half-watched. I had to rewind the episode and rewatch certain scenes in order to understand why things were happening the way they were. This defined how I recommended to show to people&mdash;it&rsquo;s a fantastic show, but you can&rsquo;t watch it while you&rsquo;re doing something else. Some of the most important moments are subtle and easily missed if your attention is elsewhere. Recently, </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fortune.com/2023/12/19/netflix-chief-product-officer-eunice-kim-second-screen-phone/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1735072285620353&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hMfw31mWWfxaz4-DkxFhF">Netflix has noticed </a></span><span>that many people, like myself, watch their shows on a &ldquo;second screen&rdquo;. What would it mean to make a show meant for a second screen? It wouldn&rsquo;t be a show like </span><span class="c0">Succession</span><span class="c3">, that&rsquo;s for sure. It would be a show that doesn&rsquo;t need engagement to be good. You could tune in and out of it and be entertained with every random glance. The plot, if it exists, would be clearly explained to you every step of the way. It would be the visual equivalent of a pop song. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Taylor Swift has no shortage of pop song singles, but those are not the ones that her fans are obsessed with nor have her singles been the drivers behind her success. People are listening to her albums in full. I don&rsquo;t think Taylor Swift songs in those albums are difficult to understand or somehow great convoluted works of literature, but I do think you need to pay attention to them in order to fully appreciate them. Anthony Fantano and </span><span class="c0">So Long, London </span><span>&nbsp;is only one of countless examples I have encountered. This is I think the key to understanding both why Taylor Swift has such a large and engaged fanbase while outsiders remain baffled. The barrier to entry is not steep, but it is there. You have to stop and pay attention for a moment. It feels precious, it feels secret, it drives the feeling of exclusivity, it feeds the Swiftian parasocial relationship. People listen to music all the time, but they look without seeing. The Swifties are annoying, but they </span><span class="c0">see</span><span class="c3">. The terrifying and searing truth is that Taylor Swift&rsquo;s fans are not victims of our Slop Decade, but the one of the last bulwarks against it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
