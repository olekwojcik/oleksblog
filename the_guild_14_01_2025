It was created by Felicia Day and was inspired by her own addiction to World of Warcraft. The show opens with the main character, Codex(her avatar name, played by Felicia Day) arguing with her therapist about her MMO addiction. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Dr Hammond</span><span class="c4">: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t grow if you&rsquo;re still immersed in an imaginary social environment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Codex</span><span class="c4">: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not imaginary&hellip;I play with real people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Dr Hammond</span><span class="c4">: &ldquo;Have you met them? Face to face?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Codex</span><span class="c4">: &ldquo;I hear them. It&rsquo;s good enough for the blind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c9 c11"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The show goes on to explore the often mocked but not often closely examined relationship between people who play an MMO together. They have a paradoxical relationship of both extreme familiarity and unfamiliarity. According to Codex, the six members of the titular Guild spend around six hours a day with one another, but only during the events of the show do they meet one another in person for the first time. Up until that point, they are unaware of what the other Guild members do for a living, what they look like, or what their legal names are. One member, Tink, makes a point of not revealing her real name or much information about her personal life at all, even when meeting in-person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It becomes clear during the show that while MMO addiction has a clear negative effect on the members of the Guild and their lives(especially Clara, the negligent stay-at-home mother), most of them play so intensely because they crave a community that they&rsquo;ve been denied. Codex is avoidant, Zaboo has an overbearing mother who denies him any other relationships, Bladezz is an uncool teenage boy, Vork is a conman who lost the grandfather he was taking care of. But after meeting in person, the Guild began to develop as group and meet up more, helping each other through personal struggles. MMOs allowed them to create a community, even though it was an unorthodox one. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what&rsquo;s up with everyone being on their phones all the time? This </span><span class="c3"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wcnc.com/article/money/personal-finance/get-ahead/screen-time-adult-american-computer-ipad-iphone/275-a25c887b-f586-4bc7-bb1d-05eccdfce111%23&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736896989488235&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jCyqFEKTdLUbJeYZE_sXl">random thing I googled</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;says Americans have over 6 hours of screentime a day on average now, which is more than the amount of time Codex says the Guild spends playing together. Spending 6 hours daily playing an MMO used to be the sign of a total and complete loser, an addict, someone who has the totally wrong priorities in life. Now it&#39;s quite normal for people, especially children, to have that much daily phone screentime. Why are we not making fun of these losers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is spending hours on your phone ubiquitous, it lacks the one positive thing that MMOs had, which was interaction with real people, and the potential to build a community, even if it was disparate and flawed. I wonder how it would look to build a community in TikTok. TikTok is driven nearly completely algorithmically, and you can easily sit down and be a passive observer, as most users do. Even if you occasionally make a video or hop on a trend, or leave a comment, you will still be spending most of your time lethargically observing and doing nothing to build human connection or community. You will only develop an illusion of community, a parasocial community. A community that you believe you belong to, but to whom you share no actual, tangible connection. In an MMO, you can point out the specific individuals with whom you have a relationship, even if it is a negative one. It may be an &ldquo;imaginary&rdquo; social environment, but it </span><span class="c9 c7">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a social environment. I don&rsquo;t think the same can be said of TikTok.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Social media is addictive, as were MMOs before them. What I find fascinating is that when I was a little kid people addicted to MMOs were mocked as the lowest of the low, yet so many people are racking up higher numbers on worse platforms, and we all seem to be sort of fine about it. I suppose any show about a social media addict would be extremely boring.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/urNyg1ftMIU?si%3DrIwFosNIJt2tIcgQ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736896989488796&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PBU_zO9nDfsr5hq0cj_ME">The Guild - Do You Wanna Date My Avatar</a></span></p></body></html>
