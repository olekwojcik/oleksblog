Dragon Age)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent a lot of time over the past decade and a half lurking on Dragon Age forums observing the debates and theorycrafting there. Dragon Age is (excluding Veilguard) a game in which its fictional religions play a very large role within its larger themes of individuals dealing with institutions. During that time, I noticed two big mistakes that nearly everyone seemed to make there when discussing religion, and have noticed those mistakes manifest within many discussions of real-world religions as well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c7 lst-kix_ub50dp9vwpl2-0 start" start="1"><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Religion&rdquo; can be neatly separated from other institutions or philosophies.</span></li><li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Different religions are interchangeable and fulfill similar roles in different societies, and share the same broad values.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these fallacies originate from the Christian conception of what religion and its purpose is. The first fallacy originates from Enlightenment thought&rsquo;s reaction to the Christian institution of religion: the idea of separation of church and state, and things like the establishment clause in the American Constitution. The second fallacy comes from Christianity&rsquo;s nature as an evangelical religion, aiming to convert the heretics and pagans to the &ldquo;true&rdquo; faith, a feature not present in many religions. The values often projected onto other religions come from Christianity as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because religion in the real world is complicated and hard, I will demonstrate these fallacies within the context of Dragon Age religions, an arena in which I am totally safe from attack because no one can claim I am misrepresenting any real-world faith or ideology. Any associations that may be drawn between these fake religions and anything in the real world is entirely upon the reader and not me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religions of Dragon Age are many, but the ones I want to focus on are Andrastianism, the Qun, the Stone, and the Elven Gods.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Andrastianism</span><span class="c0">: The monotheistic and deist Christian stand-in, Andrastianism originated from the Prophet Andraste, and is an evangelical religion that teaches if its Chant of Light is spread to all four corners of the Earth, the omnipotent Maker will return and make the world into a paradise. It has classic Christian Slave Morality values: slavery is wrong, protecting the weak, feeding the poor, etc.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The Qun</span><span class="c0">: A rip-off of Plato&rsquo;s Republic, the Qunari believe that everyone is meant for a certain role, whether as a farmer, or craftsman, warrior, or scholar. The only choice in the world is to fight against our nature or to embrace it. The Qunari run a very authoritarian society that tolerates no insubordination, the principles of the Qun informing every single aspect of daily life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The Stone</span><span class="c0">: The dwarves that live underground revere the Stone, though not as a god. The Stone is not omnipotent or perfect, but she is the creator of the dwarves, and worthy dwarves return to the Stone when they die, which is why if Dwarves worship anyone, it&rsquo;s their ancestors. Dwarven society has a strict caste system, with the Noble Caste at the top and the Casteless, who go effectively unacknowledged, at the bottom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The Elven Gods</span><span class="c0">: The elven gods, according to legend, once walked among their people when they were all immortal. Those gods were tricked and locked away by Fen&rsquo;Harel, the Dread Wolf, and the elves, without their gods to protect them, fell to invasion by the humans and became mortal. Mostly everything that is known about the elven gods has been lost or destroyed, and the elves that keep up their faith desperately seek any scrap of information they can find on it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qun and the Stone are religions that are not as traditionally &ldquo;religious&rdquo; as Andrastianism, in that they have a smaller emphasis on belief in the supernatural, and instead serve more as systems in which society is organized. The Qun especially is only debatably a religion, because it is more a philosophy and a way of life. But with regards to the first fallacy, the dwarves and their reverence of the Stone is the more interesting example because it is difficult to shake out which aspects of their society are &ldquo;religious&rdquo;. They have no dedicated priests or really organized religion at all, yet their caste system and ancestor worship are all invariably tied to the Stone. What would it even mean to be an &ldquo;atheist&rdquo; for the dwarves? Their belief in the Stone is not necessarily supernatural, the Stone is all around them. Is the caste system &ldquo;religious&rdquo;, or does its injustice go deeper? Would removing faith in the Stone also remove the existence of caste? Ostensibly perhaps, but practically, I&rsquo;m inclined to be skeptical. Conversely, what would belief in &ldquo;the Stone&rdquo; look like without a caste system, when so much of ancestor worship is tied to it? I&rsquo;ve seen too many discussions that too quickly draw lines here. The simple fact of the matter is that we, and the Andrastians, live in a society where we are taught that religion and its institutions can be clearly compartmentalized. That is not really true at all even for us and the Andrastians, but it is especially untrue in other contexts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fallacy I find more egregious and prevalent. A profoundly misunderstood character in Dragon Age is an Andrastian elf called Sera. Sera was raised by humans and is quite hostile to the idea of the elven gods and the elves reclaiming their ancient inheritance that was stolen from them and so on. I&rsquo;ve seen so many people call Sera a self-hating elf, a bigot, a racist, and so on. Now that may be true to a certain extent, but Sera is not rejecting the elven gods out of only prejudice. The elven gods represent different values than Andrastianism. The elven gods include Elgar&rsquo;nan, god of the sun, Andruil, goddess of the hunt, June, god of crafts. They are not gods of moral values. Mythal can be said to be a goddess of justice, but even then she does not seem to promote the kind of egalitarian values Sera believes in. Sera is Dragon Age Robin Hood, running an anti-noble organization called the Red Jennies that steals from the rich and gives to the poor. She has no use for gods of nature and craft, what drives her is something else. She is an Andrastian because the values of Andrastianism speak to her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion is more than just an identity you can switch out like outfits or political parties. Some religions actively seek out to convert you, which is why they portray other religions as something that can be easily discarded. Andrastianism and the Qun are both such religions, which is why their adherents go to war so often in order to control certain populations and lands. But what would it mean for a human to worship the elven gods, or for an elf to start worshipping the Stone? It would make little sense, though maybe the details could make for an interesting story. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rant Over</span></p></body></html>
